# Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science.</br>
## Myapp.py
In this project I developed web_app which displays the closing stock price and the volume stock of Infosys.</br>
In the same way we can do it for any other company using their respective ticker symbol.</br>
** TICKER SYMBOL ** - A ticker symbol is an arrangement of characters—usually letters—representing particular securities listed on an exchange or otherwise traded publicly
