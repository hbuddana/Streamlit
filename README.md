# Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science.
In this project I developed web_app which displays the closing stock price and the volume stock of Infosys.
In the same way we can do it for any other company using their respective ticker symbol
TICKER SYMBOL - A ticker symbol is an arrangement of characters—usually letters—representing particular securities listed on an exchange or otherwise traded publicly
