# Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science.</br>
## Myapp.py
In this project I developed web-app which displays the closing stock price and the volume stock of Infosys.</br>
In the same way we can do it for any other company using their respective ticker symbol.</br>
### TICKER SYMBOL </br>
- A ticker symbol is an arrangement of characters—usually letters—representing particular securities listed on an exchange or otherwise traded publicly

# Classifier.py
In this project I have developed a web-app using streamlit which displays the three datasets on the side-bar and three widely used machine learning classifiers we can alter the classifiers and can look at the accuracy of each classifier on each dataset. 

# Mushroom_app.py
In this project I have developed a web-app using streamlit which uses the mushroom dataset and classifies whether that mushroom is edible or not.
