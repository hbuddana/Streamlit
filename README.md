# Streamlit
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science.
In this project I developed web_app which displays the closing stock price and the volume stock of Infosys.
In the same way we can do it for any other company using their respective ticker symbol.</br>
*TICKER SYMBOL* - A ticker symbol is an arrangement of characters—usually letters—representing particular securities listed on an exchange or otherwise traded publicly
